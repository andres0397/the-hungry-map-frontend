### Architecture

This app uses the **Next.js** framework with TypeScript, following principles of **Clean Architecture** to support future growth and maintain separation of concerns.

We organize the project into four layers:

1. **Domain** ‚Äì business rules and entities
2. **Application** ‚Äì use cases and application logic
3. **Infrastructure** ‚Äì data sources, APIs, external services
4. **Presentation** ‚Äì UI and framework-specific code (React/Next.js)

Although not every pure concept of Clean Architecture applies directly in a React/Next.js environment, our approach is inspired by its principles and adapted for flexibility.
